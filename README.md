# What is Torch?
Torch is the successor to SE Server Extender and gives server admins the tools they need to keep their Space Engineers servers running smoothly. It features a user interface with live management tools and a plugin system so you can run your server exactly how you'd like. Torch is still in early development so there may be bugs and incomplete features.

# Features
* WPF-based user interface
* Entity manager
  * Realtime modification of ingame entities such as stopping grids and changing block settings without having to join the game
* Organized, easy to use configuration editor
* Extensible using the Torch plugin system

# Official Plugins
* [Essentials](https://github.com/TorchAPI/Essentials): Adds a slew of chat commands and other tools to help manage your server.
* [Concealment](https://github.com/TorchAPI/Concealment): Adds game logic and physics optimizations that significantly improve sim speed.
